Breast cancer detection 



Problem 1 )Data Consists of Outlier in several Columns
Problem 2) Data consists of Left sweeknews in several Columns
Problem 3) Data consists of Zero or Missing values in several Columns
Problem 4) Data is unbalanced in terms of Cancer(“0”) counts 234 and Not Cancer (“1”) counts 42  [ Ratio 5:1]



Machine Learning Prediction Results 

I have applied 6 different Machine learning model with Unbalanced and Balanced data 

Machine learning models 

RandomForest
Naive Bayes
SVM
KNN
Logistic Regression
Xgboost

Data Balance Techniques

 
Downsampling Techniques    Near Miss

Upsampling Techniques  1) SMOTETomek 2) RandomOverSampler


In  last slide I have shown the result of all machine learning models with unbalanced and balanced data

Red colour represent Highest accuracy on the basis of F1 score with existing models and techniques 

Blue colour represent Second Highest accuracy on the basis of F1 score  with existing models and techniques
